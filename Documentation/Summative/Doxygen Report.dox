Taps wars is a player vs. player tapping game where the person who reaches the requires score first wins.
To start the game simply choose what goal you want to be aiming for then you can mash away.
Each button press increases your score by 2 and reduces your opponents by 1.
At the end of the game you can see how many points each player finished with.
